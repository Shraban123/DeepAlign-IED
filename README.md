# Enhancing Deep Consistent Graph Metric with Affinity and Alignment for Incremental Social Event Detection using Cross-Layer Attention

Step 1: run generate_initial_features.py to generate the initial features for the messages.

Step 2: run custom_message_graph.py to construct incremental message graphs.

Step 3: run main.py with desired loss setting (setting 1: only attention, setting 2: attention + affinity, setting 3: attention + affinity + alignment, for more details refer to the paper)
